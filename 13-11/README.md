This project is for my Software Development class. Here are the instructions I followed to make my octagon:
(The Octagon class) Write a class named Octagon that extends GeometricObject and implements the Comparable and Cloneable interfaces. Assume that all eight sides of the octagon are of equal length.

The area can be computed using the following formula:
Area = (2+4/^2)*side*side

Create the Octagon and GeometricObject classes.

Write a test program that creates an Octagon object. Clone the first octagon into a second, then use the .compareTo method to compare the two objects.

Refer to pages 514-515 for an example of clone().
