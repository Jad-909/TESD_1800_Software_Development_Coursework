This project is for my Software Devolpment class. Here is what I was asked to complete with this project:
(Triangle class) Design a new Triangle class that extends the abstract GeometricObject class.

Create the Triangle and GeometricObject classes.  

Write a test program that prompts the user to enter three sides of the triangle, a color, and a Boolean value to indicate whether the triangle is filled. The program should create a Triangle object with these sides and set the color and filled properties using the input. The program should display the area, perimeter, color, and true or false to indicate whether it is filled or not.
